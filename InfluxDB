InfluxDB wont start stuck in loop



    Edit the file /etc/systemd/system/influxd.service

    Find the line "Type=forking" and comment it out by putting a '#" in front:
    Restart=on-failure
    #Type=forking
    PIDFile=/var/lib/influxdb/influxd.pid

    sudo systemctl daemon-reload

    Now you should be able to "sudo systemctl start influxdb"

The file path for step 1 might be different based on the specific Linux variant you're running, but it should be a pretty similar spot.
