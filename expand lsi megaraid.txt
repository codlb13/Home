Finding the correct menu option from the WebBIOS utility took considerable time. What you do is go into the Virtual Disks option from the left hand menu and then select Adv Opers (Advanced Operations). The Advanced Operations options allow you to change the RAID type and add drives to an existing array.

If you are keeping the RAID type the same, just choose to add the new drive. For a new drive to be added, its status needs to be "unconfigured good".
